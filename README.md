# Book-Rest-Api

Handled and managed 4 different REST API operations on the book database. The operations are:
1. Create
2. Read
3. Update
4. Delete

Employed various Spring Boot annotations to access hyperlinks. Various annotations include GetMapping, PutMapping, and so on.

Added interface service layer for secured operations with the help of Dynamic polymorphism.

Thanks for your time. 

Have a nice day!
